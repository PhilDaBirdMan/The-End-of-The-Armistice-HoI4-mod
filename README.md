This is a mod for Hearts of Iron IV. It is not designed for you to run in Europa Universalis IV, Victoria III, Crusader Kings III, a standard compiler, or literally anywhere else. 
This project is a mod that will give every country flavor, without being as confusing as Kaiserreich, as large as Millenium Dawn or TNO, and not an overhaul like Equestria at War.
This mod is intended to be three things:
1. An alternative to Road to 56
2. An overhaul for Minor Nations without trees, like Panama and the Philippines
3. A free way to experience the ability to play any nation.

Currently, the mod is made for version 1.16.8 (Countenance).
In order to run the mod, you will need to do the following:
1. download the .zip file folder off GitHub
2. extract the .zip file wherever you like
3. create a .mod file within Hoi4's /mods/ folder and add the following to the .mod file:
       name = "The End of The Armistice"
       path = (put the location of the mod here by copying the path of the folder titled "TheEndofTheArmistice", and switching all the backslashes to normal slashes.)
       supported_version = 1.16.8
4. Launch your Hearts of Iron 4 through either Steam or the Paradox Launcher. If on Steam, do not select "Skip Launcher".
5. In the Launcher, check to make sure that "The End of The Armistice" shows up as a mod in your library.

Alternatively, you could download the latest finished version off of Paradox Mods, navigate to the launcher, and check for the mod. However, that won't have the most recent version, as it's much easier to publish versions here than to Paradox.
